Day Planner

The goal of this project was to use HTML, CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap, and Javascript to develop a task scheduler. Using local storage, you can save and delete hourly events in this planner. This shows the current date, as well as color-coded past, present, and future hours.

The following is the user's story:

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

The following are the acceptance criteria:
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
